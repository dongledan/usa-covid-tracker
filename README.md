# [Spread FACTS, Not COVID](https://usa-covid-tracker.vercel.app/)

## Objective

The only thing spreading faster than COVID is misinformation. I built this SPA to simply show what the numbers are in the USA. Specifically individual states and which counties have the most daily cases + deaths. People are dying-- wearing a mask is the absolute bare minimum thing you can do.

## Tech Stack

- Javascript (Node.js)
- React
- HTML
- CSS/SASS

## Resources

Data was receieved by the [Worldometer API](https://www.worldometers.info/) & [Johns Hopkin API](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)

## Available Scripts

### To run project

#### `npm install`
To install the necessary packages used in the project.

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run test`

After all that, it should look like this!
